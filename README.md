# Breast Cancer Prediction

This project is designed to predict breast cancer based on diagnostic features extracted from a breast mass. It uses machine learning algorithms to classify tumors as benign or malignant. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Introduction
Breast cancer is a prevalent and life-threatening disease. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project aims to assist in breast cancer diagnosis by predicting tumor malignancy from diagnostic features.

## Installation
git clone https://github.com/boahan/CancerPrediction.git

Install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to train models and make predictions.


## Dataset
The breast cancer dataset used in this project is the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset, which is available in data/data.csv. This dataset contains various features used for breast cancer diagnosis.

## Algorithms

1.Linear Regression
2.Decision Tree
3.Random Forest
